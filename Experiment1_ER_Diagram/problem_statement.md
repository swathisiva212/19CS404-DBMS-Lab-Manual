# ER Diagram Workshop – Submission Template

## Objective
To understand and apply ER modeling concepts by creating ER diagrams for real-world applications.

## Purpose
Gain hands-on experience in designing ER diagrams that represent database structure including entities, relationships, attributes, and constraints.

# Scenario A: City Fitness Club Management

**Business Context:**  
FlexiFit Gym wants a database to manage its members, trainers, and fitness programs.

**Requirements:**  
- Members register with name, membership type, and start date.  
- Each member can join multiple programs (Yoga, Zumba, Weight Training).  
- Trainers assigned to programs; a program may have multiple trainers.  
- Members may book personal training sessions with trainers.  
- Attendance recorded for each session.  
- Payments tracked for memberships and sessions.

### Relationships and Constraints

1.MembershipType - MemberProgram - Trainer
Relationship: MemberProgram
Cardinality: Many MembershipTypes to Many Trainers
Participation: Partial on both sides (not all members may have programs or trainers, and trainers may work with multiple members)

2.MembershipType - PersonalTrainingSession - Trainer
Relationship: PersonalTrainingSession
Cardinality: One MembershipType can have many PersonalTrainingSessions (1:N), and many sessions may be conducted by one Trainer (N:1)
Participation: Total on sessions (each session must link membership and trainer), partial on MembershipType and Trainer

3.PersonalTrainingSession - Attendance
Relationship: Attendance
Cardinality: One PersonalTrainingSession can have many Attendance records (1:N)
Participation: Total on Attendance (each attendance record must reference a session), partial on session

4.Trainer - Payment
Relationship: Trainer makes Payment
Cardinality: One Trainer may have multiple Payments (1:N)
Participation: Partial on both sides (trainers may or may not have payments, payments are linked to one trainer)

## Constraints:
1.MembershipType is uniquely identified by MemberID; Session by SessionID; Trainer by TrainerID; and Payment by PaymentID.

2.PersonalTrainingSession depends on MembershipType and Trainer (associative relationship).

3.Attendance tracks each member’s participation in training sessions with attributes like attendance date and status.

4.Payments are tied to trainers to record transactions such as fees received.


### Assumptions
Each member must have a unique membership type assigned.

Trainers specialize in specific areas and conduct personal
# Scenario B: City Library Event & Book Lending System

- Library organizes events; members can register.  
- Each event has one or more speakers/authors.  
- Rooms are booked for events and study.  
- Overdue fines apply for late returns.

### Assumptions
A member must exist before borrowing books or registering for events.
A book may or may not be borrowed; not all books will always have loans.
Fines are only generated if a book is returned late.
